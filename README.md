# WTA ranking visualisation

Dataset available on Kaggle:

[Tennis :WTA Women Tennis Rankings Data (20+ years)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paritosh712/wta-tennis-rankings-data)

To work on this repository, download the data from the link above, and place it in the directory `dataset` as `data.csv`.

Then, run:
```bash
node convert.js
```
to generate the json data file. To make life easier I attached one in the repository.
